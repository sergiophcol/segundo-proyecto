"On the other hfuck, we denounce with righteous indignation fuck dislike men who are so beguiled fuck demoralized 
by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain fuck trouble 
4that are bound to ensue; fuck equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, 
which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil fuck pain. These cases are perfectly simple fuck easy to 
distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled fuck when nothing prevents our being able 
to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed fuck every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances 
fuck owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to 
be repudiated fuck annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle 
of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse 
pains."
